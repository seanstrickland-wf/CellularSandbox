# Cellular Sandbox

Inspired by Conway's Game of Life, this web application allows you to customize the rules of a 
cellular automata within the bounds of a 100x100 cell grid.  Specify the possible cell states,

occur with a simple json configuration file described below.

## Condition

A condition is an equation used to specify whether a state transition should occur.
